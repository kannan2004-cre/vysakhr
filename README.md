âœ¨ Core Features & Uniqueness
This is not just another portfolio website. Every element has been crafted to be simple, interactive, and futuristic.

1. Bespoke Design Philosophy
The entire website is built from scratch using React and pure CSS. No UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind were used. This ensures a lightning-fast, lightweight, and completely original design that is not bound by the constraints of a pre-built system.

2. The "Weaver's Shuttle" Navigation
The navbar is one of the site's signature features.

Desktop: An elegant, pill-shaped "shuttle" smoothly glides between links as you scroll or click, inspired by the shuttle on a traditional Kerala handloom. This provides a fluid and tactile feedback loop.

Mobile: To avoid a standard hamburger menu, a "Menu" button reveals an immersive, full-screen overlay with large, easily tappable links that animate into view.

3. The "Grid Reveal" Portfolio
The portfolio rejects the standard grid in favor of a more engaging experience.

It initially presents a clean grid of minimalist placeholders, each bearing a project title.

On hover, the placeholder animates open with a sharp split-reveal effect, unveiling the photograph beneath like curtains drawing apart. This turns Browse into a satisfying, interactive discovery process.

4. Immersive Details
Custom Cursor: A subtle, accent-colored cursor follows the user, transforming on hover over interactive elements. This small detail makes the entire site feel more responsive and premium.

Dynamic Theming: A clean toggle allows users to switch between a festive Light Mode ("Onam Sadya") and a dramatic Dark Mode ("Pooram Night"), with colors inspired by the vibrant festivals of Kerala.

Pure CSS Animations: All animations, from the "Weaver's Shuttle" to the "Grid Reveal" and scroll-based fade-ins, are created with pure CSS transitions and keyframes, ensuring smooth performance without relying on external libraries.
